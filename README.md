### Getting started locally

You want to run DigitalLeaf's Rails app locally, eh? I hope you are using it for ethical purposes. Let's get started.

1. Install Ruby and Rails. Here is a step-by-step: [Rails Girls Guide] (http://guides.railsgirls.com/install)
2. Clone this repository
3. In your terminal, in your cloned repository directory, run `gem install bundler`
4. Make sure that you have a database downloaded and installed (i.e. PostgreSQL, MySQL).
5. Adjust `config/secrets.yml` and `config/database.yml` files if using PostgreSQL
6. Edit `Gemfile` to include dependencies, edit database drivers, etc.
7. Run `bundle install` in your project's root folder

8. If all goes well, run `rails s` from the terminal in your project's root folder
9. You should be running locally: find your site at http://localhost:3000

### Good to know

Configuration files `database.yml` and `secrets.yml` use environment variables for security purposes - if they are needed, please request access.
